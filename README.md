# Dialysis-Data-Analysis-Netherlands

**SUGGESTIONS FROM THE STUDY**
**Government/healthcare sector**: Since the burden of kidney disease is ever increasing, increasing support for development of mobile devices through academic research or company funding would help relieve more costs.

**Hospitals/Dialysis centers**: Incentives like green dialysis (recovery of waste water from dialysis) would help recover some utilities cost for the dialysis centers. Active participation from caregivers could also take the pressure off from staff at the hospital. Adherence to medicines is a genuine problem among dialysis patients, also leads to prolonged treatment. Caregivers could be involved in this as well.

**Patient**: Opting for a more gentle dialysis option such as peritoneal dialysis could help save costs (unless otherwise advised by the clinicians). It also gives more social mobility, ensuring peace of mind and communal life, a healthy path for chronic patients.

**Dataset**

The dataset originates from the kidney atlas, an initiative aimed at mapping information about care and associated costs for individuals with kidney disease in the Netherlands, including regional variations. It is generated using data from the Vektis database, which contains declared healthcare data for nearly all residents of the Netherlands.
The dataset provides detailed insights into:
The number of kidney patients in the Netherlands and across different regions.
Associated healthcare costs, including hospital care and medication use.
Clinical outcomes and coexisting conditions for both kidney patients and the general population (for comparison).
One of the key features of this dataset is its focus on secondary care data, with the ability to trace patients with kidney disease using diagnosis-treatment combinations (DBCs). This enables a granular analysis of the types of care provided and the financial implications.
Data is updated annually, covering the period from 2012 to 2021, and is managed by Nefrovisie, the quality agency for kidney care in the Netherlands. By leveraging this dataset, researchers and policymakers can gain valuable insights into trends, costs, and healthcare delivery for individuals with kidney disease, enabling evidence-based decisions to optimize care and allocate resources effectively.
The kidney atlas is publicly accessible via nieratlas.nl, where the data is visualized and made available for research and policy analysis. Its open nature supports transparency and facilitates data-driven improvements in kidney care.


**Why this dataset?**

Since 2020, during my postdoctoral studies, I have focused on improving dialysis methods, specifically through a sorbent-assisted peritoneal dialysis (PD) model. My aim has been to enhance patient mobility and overall quality of life—key factors for improving long-term outcomes for kidney patients.
Peritoneal dialysis (PD) offers several advantages over hemodialysis (HD), including greater flexibility for patients and potentially fewer hospital visits. However, while quality of life is challenging to quantify directly, cost-effectiveness is measurable. This dataset is particularly valuable because it provides detailed information on healthcare costs for both HD and PD. By analyzing this data, I can validate the notion that PD is not only a gentler alternative but also a more cost-effective one compared to HD.
Additionally, the dataset's granularity—covering care costs, medication use, and outcomes—offers a comprehensive view that supports both regional and national healthcare decision-making. It aligns directly with my research focus and provides a data-driven foundation for advocating for improved dialysis options.

**What did I do?**

I did data cleaning and visualisation using PowerBI.
The report was written on Google Docs.
